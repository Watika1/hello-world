# hello-world

Hello!

I've been pointed to the right direction to this website in order to mingle with other like-minded people with my interests. I'm really a beginner with a huge strive to push myself forward with being able to properly script for my own games. I use Unity3D to practice different things, and love to design levels in Unreal 4. I'm testing the waters out here, and glad to know that I'm finally around people that can help!
